# Apollo vs Resend: Which Should You Use?

## Short Answer: **Stick with Resend** ✅

Apollo is **not designed** for automated transactional emails like yours.

---

## 🎯 What Apollo Is For

Apollo.io is a **sales intelligence and prospecting platform**:
- Finding leads and contact information
- Sending personalized **outbound sales emails** (cold outreach)
- Email sequences for sales teams
- Lead enrichment and prospecting
- **Manual sales workflows**

**Apollo doesn't even have a native email API!** It requires you to integrate with Mailgun or SendGrid anyway.

---

## 📧 What You Need (What You Have)

Your use case requires **transactional/automated emails**:
- ✅ Welcome emails triggered by form submission
- ✅ Automated email sequences (Day 3, 6, 10, 14)
- ✅ PDF attachments (checklist)
- ✅ API-driven email sending
- ✅ Developer-friendly integration

**Resend is perfect for this** - it's built specifically for transactional emails.

---

## 🔄 Can You Use Apollo Instead?

**Technically possible but NOT recommended:**

1. **Apollo requires Mailgun/SendGrid integration anyway**
   - You'd still need Resend (or Mailgun/SendGrid)
   - Apollo doesn't send emails directly
   - Adds complexity without benefits

2. **Apollo is MUCH more expensive**
   - Apollo: Starts at $49/month (sales tool pricing)
   - Resend: Free tier (3,000 emails/month) or $20/month

3. **Apollo is designed for manual sales, not automation**
   - Built for sales teams doing outreach
   - Not optimized for automated sequences
   - Would require significant code changes

4. **You'd lose features you need**
   - PDF attachments: Not Apollo's strength
   - Developer API: Apollo's API is for prospecting, not sending
   - Automated triggers: Not what Apollo does
